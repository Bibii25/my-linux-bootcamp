# Day 1 of Basic Linux - Introduction to Terminal and Navigating the File System

- Opened terminal

- Created a clone of my Linux Bootcamp repository locally.
 This allows me to edit files offline before pushing to Github.

- Learned 'pwd' command - Used to check current directory.
- Learned 'cd' command - Used to change directory
- Learned 'ls' command - Used to list files and directories

Example commands:

'''bash

pwd
cd my-linux-bootcamp
ls
