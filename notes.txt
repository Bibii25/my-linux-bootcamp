# Day 1 Practice

- Created a new directory using "mkdir" 
- Created a text and shell file
Text file - Writing notes
Shell file - Running basic scripts

- Used "chmod +x" - To change the mode of the file and add execute permissions
Learned other permissions:
r = read
w = write
x = execute

- Used "./filename" - to indicate the current directory and filename for running an executable file
or script.

- Used "nano filename" - to look into files and edit

Sample script:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello there, keep your head up!"
